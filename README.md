# Bovine_match
BovineMatch helps farmers instantly identify 73 different cow and buffalo breeds. Just use the app to take a picture, and our AI tells you the exact breed, making herd management quick and easy.

# 🐂 BovineMatch: Instant Breed Identification via Mobile AI

## 🌟 Project Overview

**BovineMatch** is an innovative computer vision project dedicated to bringing rapid, high-accuracy breed classification directly to livestock farmers. We are building the definitive AI tool capable of identifying **73 distinct bovine breeds** (cattle and buffalo) from field images.

### How it Works (The User Experience)

Our goal is simplicity and speed:

1.  **Snap a Picture:** A farmer uses our mobile application to take a photo of an animal in their herd.
2.  **Upload & Match:** The image is uploaded to our powerful AI backend.
3.  **Instant ID:** The system instantly outputs the **exact breed name** from our database of 73 types.

This is all about replacing guesswork with solid data to make herd management faster and smarter.

## 💾 The Dataset & Core Technology

The success of **BovineMatch** hinges on building a massive, gold-standard dataset.

* **Target Breeds:** 73 Bovine Breeds (Cattle & Buffalo).
* **Methodology:** Deep Learning (CNNs) for image classification.
* **Current Focus:** Meticulous data acquisition, cleaning, and labeling to ensure high-quality training data that reflects real-world conditions (varied lighting, angles, backgrounds).
